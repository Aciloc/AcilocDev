# Aciloc

**The Visual, Semantic, Full-Stack Compiler.**

> "Screens don’t run apps. Systems do."

## 1️⃣ The Current Landscape (The Problem)

Today’s software development ecosystem is fundamentally fragmented.

### The "Frontend First" Silo
Tools like **v0, Lovable, Bolt, Framer, and Webflow** excel at:
*   UI generation
*   Component scaffolding
*   Visual design

**But they largely stop at:** Screens, static interactions, and shallow logic.

### The "Backend & Automation" Silo
Tools like **Firebase, Supabase, n8n, and Zapier** handle the logic.
**But they require:**
*   Manual wiring
*   Schema design & Auth rules
*   Infrastructure knowledge

### The Result: "Glue Code"
Developers are forced to glue multiple tools together. Logic is scattered. Systems are fragile. Design execution is disconnected from backend reality.
**"Demo-ready" ≠ "Production-ready"**

---

## 2️⃣ The Gap
What does **NOT** exist today is a single platform where:
*   UI Design
*   Backend Logic
*   Data Models
*   Workflows
*   Execution

...live together as **one coherent system**.

We are building a tool where design elements have **semantic meaning**, visual flows **compile into real backend logic**, and the backend is never an afterthought.
A system that guarantees **Design ↔ Code parity** and **Deterministic output**.

## 3️⃣ What is Aciloc?

Aciloc is building a **visual, semantic, full-stack compiler**.

*   We do NOT "guess code".
*   We assemble systems.

**Core Belief:** Screens don’t run apps. Systems do.

### What Aciloc Enables
With Aciloc, a user can:
1.  **Visually Design the Frontend:** Using controlled, semantic components. Every component has intent. No free-form drawing.
2.  **Visually Define Backend Logic:** Data entities, Auth & permissions, Business rules, and Event-driven workflows (n8n-style).
3.  **Wire Everything Together:** UI actions → Backend actions. Triggers → Flows → Side effects. Deterministic connections.
4.  **Run Real Applications:** Real databases. Real APIs. Real Auth. Production-grade foundations.

---

## 4️⃣ What Aciloc is NOT

*   **NOT** just a frontend generator.
*   **NOT** just a no-code toy.
*   **NOT** just an AI wrapper.
*   **NOT** just another backend framework.

**Aciloc does NOT:**
*   Hallucinate architecture.
*   Write unsafe backend code.
*   Replace engineering thinking.
*   Compete with foundation LLMs.

---

## 5️⃣ Guiding Principle (The Golden Rule)

> **If the backend is weak, the product is pretending.**
> Everything Aciloc builds must honor this.

---

## 6️⃣ Internal Philosophy

*   **Design is not decoration.** Design is structured intent.
*   **Backend is not code.** Backend is rules, state, and guarantees.
*   **AI is not the product.** AI is a reasoning assistant, not the source of truth.
*   **Determinism beats intelligence.**
*   **Constraints beat creativity.**

---

## 7️⃣ What Success Looks Like

Aciloc succeeds when:
*   A founder can go from **Idea → Working System**.
*   A designer can build something that **actually runs**.
*   A developer **trusts** the generated backend.
*   A demo does **not collapse** in production.
*   The product **scales** without rewrites.

**Long-Term Vision:** To become the default way software systems are designed — visually, semantically, and correctly.
